# 02: Suggestion on Development Approach

**Question:** What do you suggest me to do. Develop a separate package or directly integrate it in Xcode?

**Answer:** For self-management, developing a separate Swift package (forked from TunnelKit) is better for modularity, reusability, and easier updatesâ€”integrate it via SPM in your main project. If you prefer direct integration, add the source files to your Xcode target's "Compile Sources" phase, but this can lead to maintenance overhead. Start with a separate package to isolate changes, then decide based on your project's scale.
