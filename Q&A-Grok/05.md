# 05: Replacing openssl-apple with Updated swift-crypto

**Question:** There was a previous dependency `openssl-apple`, and it's obsolete now. So I have used updated `swift-crypto`, what do you think?

**Answer:** Replacing obsolete `openssl-apple` with Apple's `swift-crypto` is a smart upgrade for better security, performance, and maintenanceâ€”`swift-crypto` is actively maintained and integrates well with Swift. However, code inspection shows the project still heavily uses OpenSSL: Obj-C files (e.g., `CryptoAEAD.m`, `TLSBox.m`) import OpenSSL headers like `<openssl/evp.h>` and `<openssl/ssl.h>`, and Swift files reference OpenSSL algorithms. `swift-crypto` only covers low-level crypto primitives and doesn't replace OpenSSL's TLS protocol or X.509 handling. You'll need OpenSSL available (e.g., via Homebrew or system libs) or fully migrate the crypto code to `swift-crypto`/`CryptoKit`, which may require significant refactoring. Test VPN connections thoroughly, as incomplete replacement could break functionality.
