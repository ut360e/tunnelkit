# 10: Adding OpenSSL.xcframework as Dependency

**Question:** How to add `OpenSSL.xcframework` as dependency here instead of `openssl-apple`.

**Answer:** For SPM: Replace in Package.swift: Change `.package(url: "https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/OpenSSL.git", from: "1.0.0")` and link in targets. For manual: Download xcframework, sign, drag into Xcode Frameworks, set Embed & Sign. Update code to import OpenSSL instead of openssl-apple. Test build. If issues, use SPM for simplicity.
