# 08: Overcoming Code Signing for openssl-apple

**Question:** For using `https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/openssl-apple`, I faced an issue from Apple like ITMS-91065: Missing signature for Frameworks/openssl.framework/openssl. Now if I use `https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/openssl-apple`, I need to do code signing. How we can overcome that?

**Answer:** ITMS-91065 requires third-party SDKs to include a valid code signature. Since `openssl-apple` is unmaintained and lacks one, sign it yourself: 1) Download/build the framework from the repo. 2) Use `codesign --sign "Apple Development: YourID" --timestamp=none openssl.framework` (replace with your developer ID). 3) Verify with `codesign --verify openssl.framework`. 4) Embed in your app. For App Store, use a distribution certificate. If issues persist, switch to `https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/OpenSSL` (maintained, SPM-compatible). Apple may reject unsigned; test with TestFlight first.
