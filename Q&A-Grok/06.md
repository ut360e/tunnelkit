# 06: Suggestions for Replacing openssl-apple

**Question:** Please suggest a good replacement here.

**Answer:** Since the code still uses OpenSSL (e.g., EVP functions in Obj-C files), `swift-crypto` isn't a complete replacement. Suggestions: 1) **Official OpenSSL SPM package:** Use `https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/OpenSSL` (maintained, SPM-ready). 2) **LibreSSL:** Lighter alternative, available via `https://github.com/apple/swift-crypto` for some parts and LibreSSL for the rest. 3) **Apple's Security framework:** For iOS-specific crypto (e.g., replace EVP with SecKey), but requires code changes. 4) **Fork openssl-apple:** Update it yourself for continued use. Test VPN functionality after replacement, as crypto mismatches can break connections.
