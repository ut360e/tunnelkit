# 04: Swift Build Error - Missing swift-crypto Product

**Question:** If I run `swift build`, I got error like `error: 'tunnelkit': product 'swift-crypto' required by package 'tunnelkit' target 'CTunnelKitOpenVPNProtocol' not found.` What could it be?

**Answer:** The error indicates that the `swift-crypto` dependency (Apple's Swift Crypto library) is required but not resolved. From Package.swift, it's correctly listed on line 37 as `.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-crypto.git", "1.0.0" ..< "4.0.0")` and used in `CTunnelKitOpenVPNProtocol` target. Possible causes: 1) Network issues preventing SPM from fetching the package, 2) Swift version too old (requires 5.2+, project uses 5.9), 3) Cache corruption. Fixes: Run `swift package update` and `swift package resolve`, then build. If on macOS, ensure Command Line Tools are updated. Check for proxy/firewall blocking GitHub.
