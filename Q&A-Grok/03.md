# 03: Building the Library and Including in Demo App

**Question:** Another thing, I have opened the file `Demo/TunnelKit.xcodeproj` using Xcode and now I am facing error like `/Users/klouderllc/Downloads/tunnelkit/Demo/TunnelKit.xcodeproj Missing package product 'TunnelKitOpenVPN'`, `/Users/klouderllc/Downloads/tunnelkit/Demo/TunnelKit.xcodeproj Missing package product 'TunnelKitOpenVPNAppExtension'` ...... what do you think. How I should build the library then include on demo app. What should be my approach.

**Answer:** The errors indicate that Xcode can't resolve the SPM packages (TunnelKitOpenVPN, etc.) because the demo project expects them via Package.swift, but they're not set up locally. Approach: 1) Use SPM to build: Run `swift build` in the root directory to compile the package. 2) For the demo, either add the local package to the Xcode project (File > Add Packages > Add Local), or directly integrate sourcesâ€”copy Swift files from Sources/ into the demo target's sources, and handle Obj-C files separately. Build the library first with SPM, then link static libraries if needed. Test thoroughly, as direct inclusion may require fixing import paths and dependencies.
