# 01: Analysis of the Project

**Question:** Analyze this project. It's an iOS package to use with Swift Package Manager. Now I don't want to use this as a package. I want to directly include source codes to my project. What do you think? This project is not maintained anymore, maintainer abandoned this project. Besides the `https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/openssl-apple` project is also very old and not maintained anymore. From now on I have to manage myself.

**Answer:** TunnelKit is an iOS framework for VPN connections (OpenVPN and WireGuard), structured as a Swift package with multiple modules (e.g., TunnelKitCore, TunnelKitOpenVPN). Directly including source codes means copying the Swift files from Sources/ into your Xcode project, which is feasible but increases complexityâ€” you'll handle dependencies like OpenSSL yourself, as openssl-apple is unmaintained. This approach gives full control but requires managing updates, security patches, and potential conflicts manually. Since the project is abandoned, forking it and maintaining a private version is advisable to avoid issues with outdated code and dependencies.
