# Question 6: The Final, Correct Method for Setting Up the Workspace

**Your Report:** "the step 1 `### 1. The Swift Package (identified by `Package.swift`)`, is not doing `(Xcode will see this file and understand that you want to add the entire Swift Package it defines.)`"

---

## My Apology and the Correct Method

I am very sorry. My previous instruction was wrong and I apologize for the error and the frustration it caused. You are correct that adding the `Package.swift` file alone does not work. 

This guide provides the definitive and correct method. Please use this one.

The key is to **add the entire root folder** of the package, not just the `Package.swift` file.

### Step 1: Start with a Clean Workspace

- Open your `TunnelKitDev.xcworkspace` file.
- If it has any items in the Project Navigator (the left sidebar), select them and press the **Delete** key to remove them. You should have a completely empty workspace.

### Step 2: Add the Package Folder (The Correct Way)

1.  In the Xcode menu, click **File > Add Files to "TunnelKitDev"...**
2.  A file dialog will open. Navigate to the `/Users/klouderllc/Downloads/` directory.
3.  From the list of items, select the single folder named **`tunnelkit`**. Do not go inside it.
4.  Click the **Add** button.

This will add the entire `tunnelkit` folder to your workspace. Xcode will look inside, find `Package.swift`, and correctly load the entire Swift Package, including all its source files and dependencies. This is the behavior I incorrectly described before, but it will work when adding the folder.

### Step 3: Add the Demo Project

This step remains the same and should be done *after* adding the package folder.

1.  In the Xcode menu, click **File > Add Files to "TunnelKitDev"...** again.
2.  The file dialog will open. Navigate into `/Users/klouderllc/Downloads/tunnelkit/Demo/`.
3.  Select the blue project file: **`TunnelKit.xcodeproj`**.
4.  Click the **Add** button.

### Final Result

Your workspace navigator should now contain the `tunnelkit` folder (which will have a Swift Package icon) and the `TunnelKit.xcodeproj` file. Now that both are correctly loaded in the same workspace, you can select the **Demo** scheme and it will build and run successfully.

Thank you for your feedback, it helped me identify my mistake. This method is the standard practice and will work.
