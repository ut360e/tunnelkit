# Question 1: Should I directly include the source code in my project instead of using Swift Package Manager?

**Your Question:** "Analysis this project. its a iOS package i have to use using Swift Package Manager. Now i dont want you use this as a package. i want directly include source codes to my project. what do you think."

## My Analysis and Recommendation

After analyzing the `Package.swift` file and the overall structure of the **TunnelKit** project, I **strongly recommend against directly including the source code** in your project. While it is technically possible, it would introduce significant complexity and maintenance overhead.

Using the **Swift Package Manager (SPM)** is the intended and far more practical approach for integrating TunnelKit.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

### 1. Complex Modular Structure

TunnelKit is not a single, monolithic library. It's a collection of smaller, interconnected modules (or "targets" in SPM terms).

As you can see in the `Package.swift` file, there are many targets like:
- `TunnelKit`
- `TunnelKitCore`
- `TunnelKitManager`
- `TunnelKitOpenVPN`
- `CTunnelKitCore` (Objective-C/C code)
- and many more...

These modules have a complex dependency graph. For example, `TunnelKit` depends on `TunnelKitCore` and `TunnelKitManager`. If you were to add the code manually, you would have to recreate this dependency structure in your Xcode project, which would be tedious and prone to errors.

### 2. External Dependencies

The project relies on external packages:
- **SwiftyBeaver:** For logging.
- **openssl-apple:** For cryptographic functions.

SPM handles downloading and linking these dependencies automatically. If you copy the source code, you become responsible for manually downloading, adding, and updating these libraries yourself.

### 3. C and Objective-C Integration

The presence of targets like `CTunnelKitCore` and `CTunnelKitOpenVPNProtocol` indicates that this project mixes Swift with C and Objective-C code. Manually setting up the necessary bridging headers and build settings for this kind of mixed-language project is notoriously difficult to get right.

### 4. Maintenance and Updates

This is the biggest drawback of the manual approach. When a new version of TunnelKit is released with bug fixes, new features, or security patches:
- **With SPM:** You simply update the package version, and SPM handles everything.
- **Manually:** You would have to repeat the entire process of copying files, re-configuring dependencies, and resolving any new build issues. This is not sustainable in the long run.

### 5. Build Configurations

The `Package.swift` file can contain specific build settings, compiler flags, and platform requirements. These are all handled automatically by SPM. Replicating them by hand in your project's build settings would be a significant and error-prone task.

### Conclusion

While the desire for more control is understandable, the costs of manually integrating a complex package like TunnelKit far outweigh the benefits. You would essentially be taking on the role of a package manager, but without the automation.

**My recommendation is to stick with Swift Package Manager.** It will save you a great deal of time and effort, ensure your project is set up correctly, and make future updates painless.
